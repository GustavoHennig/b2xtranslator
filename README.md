# Binary(doc,xls,ppt) to OpenXMLTranslator

.NET Core library to convert Microsoft Office binary files (`doc`, `xls` and `ppt`) to Open XML (`docx`, `xlsx` and `pptx`).
You can use the [Open XML SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) to manipulate those.

Forked from a [.NET 2 Mono implementation](https://sourceforge.net/projects/b2xtranslator/) under the BSD license.

## Fork Goals and Roadmap

This fork aims to significantly expand the capabilities of the original implementation. The following sections outline planned enhancements and ongoing development goals:

### Roadmap
- **Improve Text Extraction**: Better plain text extraction with support for complex document structures
- **Extend Format Support**: Support for older Word file formats (Word 6.0, Word 95, etc.)
- **Improve Error Handling**: Graceful handling of corrupted or non-standard files
- Make it handle lists (numbers, bullet points, indents)
- Handle TextBox content: "news-example.doc"
- Symbol handling: "Bug49908.doc"

### ðŸ”§ Pending Issues
- Address parsing loops that cause applications to hang
- **Performance Optimization**: Fix extremely slow conversion scenarios
- **Memory Management**: Resolve memory leaks in large file processing
- **Parsing Stability**: Fix crashes and exceptions during document parsing
- Lists are not extracted with proper bullet symbols during text conversion
- Internal markers are being written to the output: HYPERLINK, MERGEFORMAT, DOCPROPERTY, PAGEREF... See EL_TechnicalTemplateHandling.doc, ProblemExtracting.doc, Bug51686.doc
- testPictures.doc: testPictures.doc SHAPE  \* MERGEFORMAT
- Revisit: samplehtmlfieldandlist.doc
- fastsavedmix.doc - 1 line is missing
- Entire paragraphs are missing: "Bug50936_1.doc", "ESTAT Article comparing RU-LFS-22 12 05_EN.doc", "Bug47958.doc", "Bug53380_3.doc"
- Alternative space chars need to be handled: "Bug47742.doc" (space != 20)
- URL not being shown: "pad.doc"
 
### ðŸ“Š Reliability Improvements (Planned)
- Enhanced validation of input files before processing
- Better error recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging for debugging conversion issues
- Support for timeout mechanisms in long-running operations 

## Reference Projects and Implementations
